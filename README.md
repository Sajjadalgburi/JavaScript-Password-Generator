# JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Description

In this even-numbered week, I received a startup code that already includes HTML and CSS. However, I wasn't provided with the complete JavaScript code; instead, I was tasked with building it from scratch. Essentially, I was instructed to create a random password generator that allows the user to specify the desired length of the password. The user is then prompted with a series of questions, including whether they want to include uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters.

To implement this functionality, my program takes input from the user through confirm prompts. The algorithm checks the boolean value; if it equals true to the user's preference, the program includes those characters in the random password. Otherwise, if it's false, the program excludes the prompted characters.

Despite encountering numerous challenges in my first JavaScript project, I persevered and never gave up. I embraced my failures as learning opportunities and steadily improved my understanding through the help of my peers.

    - Click on "Create repository."

Step 2: Open Terminal or Command Prompt

Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory - Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.

        - cd path/to/your/project

Step 4: Initialize Git in the Local Directory

    - git init

Step 5: Connect Local Repository to GitHub Repository - Use the following command to add a remote connection to your GitHub repository. Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-repo with the name of your GitHub repository:

        - git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

Step 6: Verify the Remote Connection - Confirm that the remote connection has been added successfully by running:

        - git remote -v

Step 7: Add and Commit Changes - Add your files to the local repository and make an initial commit:

        - git add .
        - git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 8: Push to GitHub - Push your local repository to GitHub:

    - git pull --rebase origin main
